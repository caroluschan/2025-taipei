GOALS: Construct a AI friendly development plan for a travel guide webpage which will be hosted on Github Pages
NOTE: Due to response length limitation of AI, the whole development has to be broken down into development steps and therefore this tasks exist.
PREPARTION:
- Read `plan/plan.md` for the travel plan previously planned
- Read `preparation_prompt.md` for the prompt the instructed AI to construct `plan/plan.md` previously
- Familiarize other files under `plan/`
- Further Research online to fill in details missing in `plan/plan.md` e.g. hyperlinks, images, map location, etc
- Consider your response length limitation whole planning the breakdown of the whole development into steps
TASKS:
- Construct a development plan travel guide website in HTML, CSS and JS under the directory `web/` in a file called `dev_plan.md`
- The development plan should be a full list of jobs to be executed.
- No limitation to use of technology but avoid over complication.
- No Database and Server is available. Will be hosted in Github Pages.
- Lay out UI requirement in technical terms. UI style be clean and modern.
- Specify use of infographics / images / hyperlinks / map / etc if they are useed in certain step
- The last step shd be Deployment. Lay out steps to deploy the application to Github Pages from scratch, assuming already have a github account.
