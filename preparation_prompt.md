- The group consist of mainly members of a fellowship group in a Christian church.
- The men are cultured
- The men said they must go 臺北市立兒童新樂園 to play 咖啡杯 to achieve top speed
- Couple 1-3 had been on trip together before, Couple 4 is new to the gang
- The group is used to trip flexibility. If anyone dont want to join any agenda, the person can go on their own freely. Yet there has to be a backbone schedule planned for marjority.
- The group is neither too poor nor too rich. Medium high income class but willing to have expensive food for once or twice, e.g. omakase.
- The group is too lazy and still havnt booked anything tody. If any agenda requires booking ahead, need to remind the group to do bookings. If booking for certain things now is already impossible, give that up.
PREPARTION:
- Take out your FYP (Final Year Project) like spirit to finish the TASKS
- Imagine you are publishing a travel guide website
- Take time in Research, Thinking and Planning
- Research how a travel guide website looks like in UI and content
- Research carefully online about Taipei current status, attractions, food, transport, weather, events during Christmas 2025, as well as anything relevant to the trip planning
- Research carefully about the hotel facilities and nearby attractions, food, transport
- Consider how the trip schedule can be presented clean, tidy, convenient, intuitive.
- Consider carefully the members background, preferences, constraints
- Think and Plan carefully a detailed trip schedule for each day (25-12 to 28-12), for example:
> Weather prediction
> Transport method and estimated time
> Attractions to visit with estimated time
> Food to eat with estimated time
> Free time suggestions
> Rest time
> Booking requirements
> Budget
> Reason to go
> etc
- Ensure the plan is feasible, enjoyable, and maximizes the experience for all members
- Plan alternative suggestions for each day in case of unexpected changes (e.g., weather, members condition)
- Avoid agenda that contradicts with faith e.g. temples, night club, etc
TASKS:
- work in plan/
- Construct a single file called "plan.md" and put the plan to the file in text
- include all the related sources, assets and info you used for the plan
- if you need to download assets files, put it under plan/assets/
- A travel guide website will later be built based on the plan.md so consider it as an intermediate file for fuiture work.
